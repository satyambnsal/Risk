## üéÆ Game Overview

A strategic territory control game where players battle for map dominance through zero-knowledge circuits. Noir enables client-side proving, allowing players to generate cryptographic proofs locally that verify their moves are valid without revealing strategy. The multi-party computation (MPC) framework ensures fair gameplay while maintaining the "fog of war" element essential to strategy games without central server trust.

## How to Play

1. **Initial Placement**: Players take turns placing armies on their assigned territories
2. **Attack Phase**: Attack adjacent enemy territories using dice rolls
3. **Fortify Phase**: Redeploy troops to strengthen your position
4. **Win Condition**: Capture all territories on the map!

Supports 2-6 players with varying game dynamics based on player count.

## üß© Project Structure

- **Frontend**: NextJS application with PhaserJS game engine
- **Circuits**: Noir zero-knowledge circuits in the `game_circuits` folder
- **Multiplayer**: Realtime gameplay via Colyseus.js (in development)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Circuits

The game's core logic is implemented as zero-knowledge circuits using the Noir language. These circuits handle game state transitions while maintaining player privacy.

### Core Game Circuits

The following circuits handle all game mechanics:

- `initialise_game_state`: Sets up the initial game board state
- `assign_initial_territories`: Randomly distributes territories among players
- `initialize_player_state`: Sets up a player's initial game state
- `register_all_players`: Registers all players in the game session
- `commit_to_user_secrets`: Securely stores player secrets
- `create_risk_adjacency_map`: Establishes territory connections
- `place_troops`: Allows players to place troops on territories
- `execute_attack`: Handles attack mechanics between territories
- `execute_fortify`: Allows redeployment of troops
- `end_turn`: Processes end-of-turn state changes
- `count_player_territories`: Tallies territories owned by each player
- `check_win_condition`: Determines if a player has won

### Testing

Test cases covering the full game journey for a two-player game are available in:
```
game_circuits/src/test.nr
```

Run the test suite with:
```bash
nargo test --show-output
```

### Compiling Circuits

To compile and export the circuits for use in the frontend:

```bash
nargo export
./generate_ts_bindings.sh  # Generates TypeScript bindings
```

Gate count reports for circuit complexity are available in `game_circuits/gates_report.json`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend

The game frontend is built with modern web technologies:

- **NextJS**: React framework for the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components
- **PhaserJS**: Game engine for rendering and interaction
- **Radix UI**: Component library for UI elements
- **Colyseus.js**: Multiplayer functionality (in development)

### Local Development

To run the game locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires Bun)
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</a>

## üîó Dependencies

The game circuits use the MPC library for zero-knowledge computations:

```
mpclib = { tag = "main", git = "https://github.com/zac-williamson/mpclib" }
```

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

- Persistent game state using decentralized storage
- Complete multiplayer implementation with matchmaking
